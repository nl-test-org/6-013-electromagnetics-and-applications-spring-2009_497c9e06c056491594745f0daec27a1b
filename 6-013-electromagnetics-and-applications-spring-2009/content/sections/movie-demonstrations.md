This section contains movies and demos developed with MATLAB® that illustrate concepts presented in class.

The following link also contains demos from a previous offering of the course: [Physical Demonstrations](http://web.mit.edu/jbelcher/www/anim.html) of Faraday's Law, Electrostatics, and Radiation.
